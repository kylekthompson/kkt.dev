So, I'm brand-new to the whole "blogging" thing, but I figured I'd give it a go. This post is mostly just to serve as a
placeholder so I can make sure everything looks ok before I actually get to the good stuff, but I might as well mention
what I think I'll end up talking about here.

At the time of writing, I am a Software Engineer at <Link href="https://root.engineering/">Root Insurance</Link>. For
the most part, we are a Ruby/JavaScript shop, so you can expect to see mostly posts in those languages (though we do use
other languages where appropriate and I enjoy tinkering with Elixir on the side).

To make sure everything looks okay, here's some arbitrary Ruby and JavaScript:

```ruby
class Blog
  attr_reader :thoughts

  def initialize(thoughts:)
    @thoughts = thoughts
  end

  def publish
    thoughts
      .reject(&:published)
      .select(&:publishable)
      .each(&:publish!)
  end
end
```

```javascript
function publishThoughts(thoughts) {
  thoughts
    .filter(({ published, publishable }) => !published && publishable)
    .forEach(publishThought);
}
```

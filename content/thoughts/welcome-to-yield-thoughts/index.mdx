So, I&rsquo;m brand-new to the whole &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; thing, but I figured I&rsquo;d give it a go. This post is
mostly just to serve as a placeholder so I can make sure everything looks ok before I actually get to the good stuff,
but I might as well mention what I think I&rsquo;ll end up talking about here.

At the time of writing, I am a Software Engineer at <Link href="https://root.engineering/">Root Insurance</Link>.
For the most part, we are a Ruby/JavaScript shop, so you can expect to see mostly posts in those languages (though we do
use other languages where appropriate and I enjoy tinkering with Elixir on the side).

Oh! One last thing (so I can test displaying code and in case anyone is curious)&ndash; the name of the blog comes from
Ruby&rsquo;s yield keyword:

```ruby
class Thought
  attr_reader :n

  def initialize(n)
    @n = n
  end

  def blog_about
    "thought #{n}"
  end
end

def with_thoughts
  yield([Thought.new(1), Thought.new(2), Thought.new(3)])
end

with_thoughts do |thoughts|
  thoughts.each(&:blog_about)
end
```
